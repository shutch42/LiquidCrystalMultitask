# LiquidCrystalMultitask Library for Arduino

This library is a fork of the LiquidCrystal library for Arduino, but with a few improvements. The goal with this project is to remove the use of delay() statements from the LiquidCrystal library, so that the main program can continue working without delay as the LCD updates.  

This will be useful for projects which require the arduino to process data at intervals on the scale of microseconds, and simultaneously update the LCD at longer time intervals.

For example, the project that I am using this for requires that audio samples be recorded every 23us, but the LCD only needs to update approx. once per second. Since an LCD write using the original LiquidCrystal library uses a 100us delay, this will cause audio samples to be missed. This updated library will allow the LCD to update without interfering with audio samples.
